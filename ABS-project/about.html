   <p style="font-size:30px";> Book Direct Through the Airlines Website
    More often than not, booking directly through the airline’s website will give you the best price,
    or will at least be the same as the OTAs.<br>
    Some airlines, like Southwest, won’t even show up on sites like Expedia or Orbitz, so you have to book direct. It can also be the most simple way to book. 
    If a problem arises, you don’t have to deal with a third party to get it resolved.
    Another reason to book directly through an airline’s website is to use frequent flyer miles — hooray for award flights!
    Of course, to book through the airline’s website, you first need to know which airline has the best prices. <br>
    There are lots of travel search engines and OTAs that can help you find the best deals so you know which airline’s website to visit. 
    Some OTAs even offer perks that might make it worth booking someplace other than the airline’s site.</p>
